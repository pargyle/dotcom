# A Game Jam attempt
This is a draft of a digital board game, centered around the idea of the dot-com bubble. Sort of like Monopoly by managing domains like real estate, but you never know when the bubble is going to pop and the game ends. Who comes out as a winner? .... what does even it mean to win in the aftermath of the dot-com burst?

Made for 2025's Global Game Jam with [Garrett Jones](https://github.com/r1tr1t), where the theme was "bubbles".
We planned so much that we never got a prototype going.
